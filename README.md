## What Gets Installed

| **Node.js** | Latest LTS version via nvm (with npm updated to latest) |
| **Claude Code** | Latest version via npm |

## After Installation

1. Open a **new terminal window** (to load PATH changes)
2. Open VS Code by typing `code` in terminal
3. Open VS Code's terminal (`Ctrl+`` on Windows, `Cmd+`` on Mac)
4. Type `claude` to start Claude Code
5. You'll be prompted to authenticate on first run

## Verify Installation

Run these commands to verify everything is installed:

```bash
code --version
git --version
node --version
npm --version
claude --version
```

## Features

- **Zero prompts** — fully automatic, skips already-installed tools
- **Idempotent** — safe to run multiple times
- **Smart detection** — checks existing installations before installing
- **Progress display** — green checkmarks for each completed step
- **Debug mode** — add `--debug` flag for troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Windows
- Run with debug mode: `install.bat -debug`
- Ensure you have internet access
- If winget is not available, the installer falls back to direct downloads

### macOS
- Run with debug mode: `curl -fsSL ... | bash -s -- --debug`
- If Xcode CLI tools prompt appears, click "Install" and wait
- If Homebrew asks for your password, enter your Mac login password
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel Macs are both supported

## Uninstall

Need to roll back? Uninstall scripts remove everything that was installed.

### Windows
```powershell
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galoriancreations/claude-code-instalaci-n-con-un-clic/main/windows/uninstall.bat" -OutFile uninstall.bat; .\uninstall.bat
```

### macOS
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galoriancreations/claude-code-instalaci-n-con-un-clic/main/mac/uninstall.sh | bash
```

> **Note:** The macOS uninstaller intentionally keeps Xcode Command Line Tools installed.
